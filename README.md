# Qwanqwa (`qq`): Language Metadata
This is a language metadata toolkit to make it easier to work with a large variety of metadata from a single interface.
Currently this metadata includes:

* Official identifiers: `iso-639-3`, `bcp-47`, Glottocode, Wikidata, Wikipedia
* Non-official identifiers: NLLB-style codes (`zho_Hans`, `zho_Hant`, etc.)[^1]
* Geographic information
* Speaker information
* Writing systems
* Names

Planned:
* Phylogenetic information
* Linking with [CLLD](https://github.com/clld) datasets
* Typological features: `grambank`, `wals`, `uriel`
* A graph-based view to traverse between languoids (family trees, geo areas, shared features etc.)
* Historical languages

**Name**: **Q**wan**q**wa is a phonetic spelling of 'ቋንቋ', which means *language* in Amharic; `qq` is nice and short to type.

## Languoids
In `qq`, language-like entities as referred to as [*Languoids*](http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Languoid), since it includes dialects, macro-languages and language areas.
Not all languoids have coverage for all features.

Number of languoids: 7511


## Usage
```
pip install git+https://github.com/WPoelman/qwanqwa
```

**Important**: `qq` makes a strict distinction between `None` (*don't know*) and `False` (*it is not the case*). Make sure to keep this in mind when checking boolean values for truthiness, so if you're interested in missing values for example, avoid `if not script.is_canonical:`, but instead explicitly check `if script.is_canonical is None:`.

```python
from qq import LanguageData, TagType

# Load from the pre-compiled database
ld = LanguageData.from_db()

# Access Languoid info using whatever official tag you have
nl1 = ld.get('nl', tag_type=TagType.BCP_47_CODE)
nl2 = ld.get('nld', tag_type=TagType.ISO_639_3_CODE)
# The `guess` method tries all known official tag types,
# be careful though since this can give unexpected resutls.
nl3 = ld.guess('dut')  # happens to be TagType.ISO_639_2_B

# In this case, these will give the same Languoid
assert nl1 == nl2 == nl3
> True

am = ld.get('am') # Default tag_type is BCP_47

# Language identifiers

> 'amh'

[^1]: This is a combination of an `iso-693-3` or `bcp-47` language tag and `iso-15924` script tag. This is similar to the first parts of an [IETF Tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), which, confusingly, can also be referred to as a `bcp-47` tag on its own. This is done in NLLB for instance. This is not wrong, but because data in `qq` is based on LinguaMeta, who interpret just the first part of a IETF tag to be a `bcp-47` tag, we're sticking to  LinguaMeta's interpretation of `bcp-47` and refer to the combined tag as `nllb_style`. The `iso-15924` part of the `nllb_style` tags are based on Glotscript, excluding Braille.
